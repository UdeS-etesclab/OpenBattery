# University of Sherbrooke Open Battery Project
# "Under construction"

The University of Sherbrooke has been working on Lithium-ion batteries since 2008. After many iterations over the years, it result by a modular, easy to manufacture and affordable battery pack design. This design made of 18650 cyclindral cells is perfect for prototypes or DIY projects.

We intent to provide here a modular mechanical structure for a rapid-prototyping and an integrated Battery Management System (BMS) for some specfic cells configuration <b>(available soon)<b> 

<b> Always be carefull with lithium-ion. We do not guarantee success in your application. <b>
